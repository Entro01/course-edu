# course-recommender
This is a recommendation engine that recommends 10 courses related to course you search.
here I build a recommendation engine on coursera courses dataset & deployed it in Heroku Platform. From this project I learned about data preparation process for NLP like lemmatization & Tokenization. After selecting the column through which we will find the recommendations, we apply TF-IDF to them to convert the words into vectors. Then finding the similar vectors we recommend top 10 courses as our output.
Here is the link of the deployed webpage of this project - â€¢	https://coursera-course-recommender.herokuapp.com/
